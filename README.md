# Discordjs bot template
This is my template for many of my discord bots.

## Setup
Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`

Open it with your favorite editor, Nano, Vim or Emacs.

Replace the `TOKEN` in the `.env` file with your own [Authentication Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)  
Replace the `GUILD_ID` in the `.env` file with your guild id.

## DO NOT MAKE THE .env FILE PUBLIC
By default, the `.env` file is not tracked by git, which can pose huge security risks if you disable this feature.
